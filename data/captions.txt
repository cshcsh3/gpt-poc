hey wonder froze welcome back to my channel it's ev and today i have a few new things to share with you one is this new lens so let me know how you like it two is this new backdrop so let me know how you like it and three is some ayurvedic hair care products that are in sephora and i absolutely love love love love this brand before i jump into it there is one more thing that's new i did switch up my editing style a little bit so i am going to be showing you guys clips in this wash day and not an entire whole thing like i normally do but i did want to keep the content fresh so if you guys like this style be sure to give this a thumbs up and subscribe down below for beauty fashion and lifestyle videos and yeah let's just jump right into it so full disclaimer these products were sent to me but this video is not sponsored the ayurvedic hair care products i'm talking about is called fable and maine and they are also available in sephora currently and i will link down below a podcast that i found of the owners of fable and maine being interviewed it's a brother and sister duo and the entire ethos of the brand i just stand behind they're like really really organic authentic people and that just made me love their products even more so i will link that down below but be sure to check that out along with these products so the entire line comes with a shampoo a conditioner a hair mask and a hair oil and the first product that i used was the conditioner as a pre-poo because i don't use normal conditioners really i don't think they do anything for my hair because i'm low porosity and i need to add heat and let things penetrate i use this as a pre-poo and i think it gave my hair a lot of slip definitely make sure you add water um on its own this is actually kind of thick obviously it's a conditioner but it's pretty thick i think it's really concentrated the ingredients are great i was able to detangle with a tool very easily i used my tangle teezer and once again i switched the use of this product specifically because this is the best way that i can use a conditioner for my texture of hair but i highly recommend this as a pre-poo if you're interested i love the fragrance i think it works effectively as a pre-poo and if you also use it as a regular conditioner i would also recommend this as well the fragrance of all of these products smells like banana to me like the like banana is the base and i typically don't like banana fragrances but this also i feel like has some florals some vanilla something sweet maybe coconut mixed in here i'm not sure but i do really like the fragrance of this and this reminds me of a perfume like i would wear this as a perfume if i could and the smell definitely does linger in your hair now obviously like i said i use this as a pre-poo so i am going to be rinsing this out but the shampoo conditioner and the hair mask all smell the same to me and the hair oil just just wait for it so the next product that i used is the shampoo this is a moisturizing shampoo but i do feel like it did give my hair a proper amount of clean so lately i've been experimenting with not using as stringent of clarifiers and that has been a lot for me because y'all know i am queen clarify i love me a good clarifier uh strip it all down take all the oil down take it back off strip the hair down to the bone okay and then put it all back because i use heavy stylers and so for me i don't want product buildup but lately because i believe in scalp health anytime you strip your skin all the way down over and over and over and over again it actually kind of causes an overproduction of oil so i've been trying to use moisturizing shampoos just to see if it would balance out the sebum production of my scalp because i believe naturally i have a lot of oil production on my scalp but i could be my own worst enemy so i have been using moisturizing shampoos back to back for about a month and this is the moisturizing shampoo that i used this past wash day and i do believe it is moisturizing once again the ingredients are great i believe that they're very concentrated like super potent you're not going to need a lot of this it lathers up really really well it smells like the conditioner like that banana floral vanilla coconut fragrance to me and once again yes the fragrance does linger in your hair i found it pretty easy to like finger detangle if that's what you're into when you shampoo some people don't start the detangling step when you shampoo and that's fine i do believe that this is pretty moisturizing so when you use this i think it's a little bit thicker than like obviously my clarifying shampoos that i like all the time but i also believe it's thicker than other shampoos so when i use this i felt like i did have to place it like in different sections like because i shampoo my hair in sections so i had to place it in different areas in order for the movement to go all throughout my hair but once it got there like i said i think it did a great job of cleansing and depositing moisture into my hair it didn't sit there like i said it suds up really well and once again fragrance popping so highly recommend this if you're in the market for a good moisturizing shampoo if you want something more clarifying obviously this gets your hair clean but does not strip it to the bone next up is the hair mask this bad boy right here i did use a lot of this product i don't know if you guys are going to be able to see that but it is kind of a soupy consistency it like i can't sit it upside down it will start to uh run out but i did use more than half of this container because i felt like i had to place it in my hair when it came to movement i do think that you should follow the directions on the jar so i put this on soaking wet hair because i was still in the shower but it does advise that you put this on damp hair and i did sleep with this in overnight like usual and i sat under a hooded dryer after rinsing this out i do believe that my you know natural super textured hair needs a little bit more moisture and that could be like i could combine it with oil or combine it with the conditioner you guys also know i like to detangle with my deep conditioners in i would not advise that you detangle with this in and i kind of felt that way in the shower now once again i did not use it as directed but i was having a little bit more difficulty like getting through so i didn't want to also take a tool to my hair at that point so i did not detangle with this end i did put it in my hair and i i kept putting it in my hair because i felt like it wasn't traveling very well but i just twisted it up and then slept with it in overnight i did eventually detangle but it was during the styling process which is fine um which was another switch up for me just trying to do things different this time around but this for me like i said i would have to add something to it in order to give me the slip that i'm looking for in order to detangle with the tool and i would recommend using this on damp hair so you can get all the benefits of the ingredients that are in here this is super concentrated also but if you have a lot of hair super dense hair or really long hair uh eight ounces you might want to get another one of these and use it as directed so this did leave my hair feeling moisturized i do like it but i know for my hair i typically want something that leaves more moisture in my hair because i only style my hair once a week and i want the moisture to last all week so if your hair does not need as much moisture as mine then this will probably be more ideal for you what i will say though is that my scalp felt amazing like all of the products after using all of the products the shampoo conditioner and the hair mask my scalp felt really really good and i've been meaning to get into aerovedic hair care for a while because a lot of people say it's strengthening it's like really organic it's it's really good for your scalp and your scalp health so i really was excited to try these products and what i can say is that my scalp was popping like like all of the products make your scalp pop not all of the products made my hair pop but i do recommend all of them for scalp health and last but not least the star of the show if you get nothing else definitely get this oil and this is the fable and main hair growth oil is it hair growth or is it just the hair oil i just i love this stuff this literally smells like perfume if they were going to make a perfume with this i would definitely get that too it smells so good to me i cannot even describe it but it's i i can't describe it it just smells phenomenal like this fragrance it doesn't even smell like anything i've smelled in hair care before to be honest with you it's so it smells so good to me i highly recommend this now this is a pre-poo overnight treatment uh for anyone who is into scalp oiling or hair growth oils you are supposed to leave this in your hair overnight and i'm actually really excited to start seeing overnight directions on things because overnight is the way to go that's what i do and i know i know you're also thinking of why would you use the conditioner as a pre-poo and then use the pre-poo as a hair oil like like what like why don't you just follow directions the thing is this you rinse out of your hair when you shampoo it that's how they advise i did not want to rinse this out of my hair because i want all of the benefits from it to stay in my hair and i've actually been using this on my scalp um i had mentioned in several videos that i get tender spots i get tender headed spots like certain times of the month and this helps alleviate that and i'm sure just like all the ayurvedic ingredients in here is what's really helping all of that happen i've been using that for a few weeks i can't say that it's definitely helped my hair grow super fast or anything you guys know i am trying to get rid of my layers in the back but i can't say yet because i just haven't been using it long enough and i haven't been monitoring it like to the nth degree like i normally do with growth things but i highly recommend the oil i think it is so good and it does the fragrance of this also lingers in your hair but for scalp health for hair growth for a good moisturizing oil highly recommend it's like the oil is it y'all the oil is it the oil is it the entire line is dope but the oil is the one highly highly recommend so that is everything i hope you guys
